Boy oh boy do I love me some retro gaming sessions of Snake. Unfortunately my
Nokia 6110 recently fell from my balcony. It didn't break, but it punched a
hole in the street and got lost into the city's sewer system, so I did what
anyone else would have done in this situation: write my own remake of the
videogame. Here, wanna take it for a spin?

I've also integrated gaming session recording logic and I am hosting a server
to upload replays! Send me yours and I shall take a look at it.
